# Inter-VLAN Routing Challenge (Packet Tracer)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the configuration of **Inter-VLAN Routing** in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The goal was to design and implement a network that enables communication between multiple VLANs using a Layer 3 device.

## Key Features
- VLAN creation and assignment to switch ports  
- Inter-VLAN routing using a router-on-a-stick setup  
- Configured trunk links between switches and router  
- Verified connectivity between devices across different VLANs

## Skills Demonstrated
- VLAN segmentation  
- Subnetting and IP addressing  
- Router-on-a-stick configuration  
- Troubleshooting with `ping` and `show` commands

## Usage
1. Open the `.pka` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
2. Inspect the VLAN setup and router configuration.  
3. Test connectivity between devices in different VLANs.  

## Future Enhancements
- Add DHCP server for automatic IP assignment  
- Implement ACLs for restricted inter-VLAN access  
- Simulate redundancy using multiple routers
